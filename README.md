This repository contains dependencies for my various projects for Visual Studio. It is designed so whenever I switch to a different computer or update my compiler I can easily rebuild everything.

The code contained within the src and include directories is not my own, although it may have some modifications by me, and is licensed under whatever license they are licensed with.  
Everything else is mine, and I release it to the public domain.
